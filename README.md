# NateBackupTools
Tools for managing backups of home PC files on external hard drives.

## About
When I back up some files, that means I use windows explorer or cp -r to duplicate them somewhere else. I like that the backed up files are 100% usable and explorable without any special software. But when I've done that 10 times for 5 computers using 3 or more external hard drives... well... it becomes desirable consolidate space and verify data integrity. Windows explorer and cp -r don't do that. Enter: NateBackupTools!
